# binary_trees
A binary tree is a type non-linear data structure in which every node or vertex has at most two children. In Python, a binary tree can be represented in different ways with different data structures(dictionary, list) and class representations for a node. However, binarytree library helps to directly implement a binary tree.

#binarytree are powerful data structures that provide hierarchical organization for data and have various applications, such as searching, sorting, and storing hierarchical data. Binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science that are used to represent hierarchical relationships between objects

To implement a search in a #binarytree with Python, you can use a recursive algorithm. The basic idea is to compare the value you are searching for with the value of the current node. If the values are equal, the search is successful and you can return the node. If the value you are searching for is less than the value of the current node, you can search the left subtree. If the value you are searching for is greater than the value of the current node, you can search the right subtree.
